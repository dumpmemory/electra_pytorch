# Replicated Results
I pretrain ELECTRA-small from scratch and has successfully replicate the paper's results on GLUE. 

|Model|CoLA|SST|MRPC|STS|QQP|MNLI|QNLI|RTE|Avg.|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|ELECTRA-Small|54.6|89.1|83.7|80.3|88.0|79.7|87.7|60.8|78.0|
|ELECTRA-Small (my)|57.2|87.1|82.1|80.4|88|78.9|87.9|63.1|78.08

**!! I can't reproduce my results above now and I currently working on it. !!**

|Model|CoLA|SST|MRPC|STS|QQP|MNLI|QNLI|RTE|Avg.|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|ELECTRA-Small++|55.6|91.1|84.9|84.6|88.0|81.6|88.3|6.36|79.7|
|ELECTRA-Small++ (finetune public checpoint using electra_pytorch)|54.8|91.6|84.6|84.2|88.5|82|89|64.7|79.92

finetuning script should be ok

Results for models on the GLUE test set.

# Features of this implementation

- You don't need to download and process datasets manually, the scirpt take care those for you automatically. (Thanks to [huggingface/nlp](https://github.com/huggingface/nlp) and [hugginface/transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers))

- AFAIK, the closest reimplementation to the original one, taking care of many easily overlooked details (described below). 

- AFAIK, the only one successfully validate itself by replicating the results in the paper.

- Comes with jupyter notebooks, which you can explore the code and inspect the processed data.

- You don't need to download and preprocess anything by yourself, all you need is running the training script.

# Usage
> Note: This project is actually for my personal research. So I didn't trying to make it easy to use for all users, but trying to make it easy to read and modify.

## Install requirements
`pip install fastai nlp transformers hugdatafast`

## Steps
1. `python pretrain.py`
2. set `pretrained_checkcpoint` in `finetune.py` to use the checkpoint you've pretrained and saved in `electra_pytorch/checkpoints/pretrain`. 
3. `python finetune.py` (with `do_finetune` set to `True`)
4. Go to neptune, pick the best run of 10 runs for each task, and set `th_runs` in `finetune.py` according to the numbers in the names of runs you picked.
5. `python finetune.py` (with `do_finetune` set to `False`), this outpus predictions on testset, you can then compress and send `.tsv`s in `electra_pytorch/test_outputs/<group_name>/*.tsv` to GLUE site to get test score.

## Notes
- I didn't use CLI arguments, so configure options enclosed within `MyConfig` in the python files to your needs before run them. (There're comments below it showing the options for vanilla settings)

- You will need a [Neptune](https://neptune.ai) account and create a neptune project on the website to record GLUE finetuning results. Don't forget to replace `richarddwang/electra-glue` with your neptune project's name

- The python files `pretrian.py`, `finetune.py` are in fact converted from `Pretrain.ipynb` and `Finetune_GLUE.ipynb`. You can also use those notebooks to explore ELECTRA training and finetuning.

# Advanced Details
Below lists the details of the [original implementation](https://github.com/google-research/electra)/paper that are easy to be overlooked and I have taken care of. I found these details are indispensable to successfully replicate the results of the paper.
- Use Adam optimizer **without bias correction** (bias correction is default for Pytorch and fastai Adam optimizer)
- There is a bug in how original implementation decays learning rates through layers. See [_get_layer_lrs](https://github.com/google-research/electra/blob/79111328070e491b287c307906701ebc61091eb2/model/optimization.py#L186)
- Use clip gradient
- For MRPC and STS tasks, it appends the same dataset with swapped sentence1 and sentence2 to the original dataset, and call it "double_unordered"
- For pretraing data preprocessing, it concat and truncate setences to fit the max length, and stop concating when it comes to the end of a document.
- For pretraing data preprocessing, it by chance split the text into sentence A and sentence B, and also by chance change the max length
- For finetuning data preprocessing, it follow BERT's way to truncate the longest one of sentence A and B to fit the max length
- Use gradient clipping
- The output layer is initialized by Tensorflow v1's default initialization which is xavier
- It use gumbel softmax to sample generations from geneartor
- It didn't mask like BERT, but mask for [MASK] for 85% and 15% remains the same
- It didn't do warmup and then do linear decay but do them together, which means the learning rate warmups and decays at the same time when warming up. See [here](https://github.com/google-research/electra/blob/79111328070e491b287c307906701ebc61091eb2/model/optimization.py#L36-L43)
- It use a dropout and a linear layer for GLUE output layer, not what `ElectraClassificationHead` uses.
- It didn't tie input and output embeddings for its generator, which is a common practice applied by many model.
- It tie not only word/pos/token type embeddings but also layer norm in embedding layer, for generator and discriminator.
- All public model of ELECTRA checkpoints are actually ++ model. See [this issue](https://github.com/google-research/electra/issues/68)
- It downscales generator by hidden_size, number of attention heads, and intermediate size, but not number of layers.

# File architecture
If you pretrain, finetune, and generate test results. `electra_pytorch` will generate these for you.
